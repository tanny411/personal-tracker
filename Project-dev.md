# Want to re-create?

Several things installed in order to create this app are (besides those in the package.json file):
- node, npm
- `npm install -g create-react-app` and `create-react-app .` on client folder. This will require node>=10 so break your bones trying to update nodejs. This may help: [Node manual installation](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md#manual-installation).
